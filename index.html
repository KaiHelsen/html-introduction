    <h5>A funny story</h5>
    <p>Several years ago, me and some friends from College were crunching on our 1st year project. For this project, we worked on a small house in maya</p>
    <p>As everyone was stressed and under pressure, people went a little loopy. Up until the point one of my friends asked: <i>Does this circle look round?</i></p>
    <p>Upon hearing this strange question I burst out in laughter and simply couldn't stop. Several others caught on and started laughing as well</p>
    <p>For about ten minutes, we just laughed while trying to work before we managed to regain a semblance of sanity.</p>
    <p>However, it started back up the moment someone said "Have you seen the book?"</p>

    <p>Someone saying <i>Does this circle look round</i> is very funny when you're stressed and tired.</p>
